## Version 1.7-5.2.3

## Resubmission
New maintainer resubmission after package was orphaned.

## Test environments

This is the unchanged package that was orphaned.
Tests were not run since dependencies (such as geoRglm)
are not available, since they were removed from CRAN
when geoR was orphaned. Once these are back on CRAN,
after geoR is back on CRAN, it will be possible to
run tests.
